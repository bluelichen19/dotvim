# dotvim
If you use Vim on muliple machines, it can be difficult to keep your configuration files synchronized across them. 
One solution is to put your dotfiles under version control. 
In this episode, I demonstrate how to keep your vimrc and plugins synchronized using git submodules and the pathogen plugin.
first 3Keep your dotfiles in git
The following instructions assume that your home directory contains 
a .vimrc file, 
a .vim directory 
and a .gvimrc file (optional).
Move the .vimrc and .gvimrc files into the .vim directory(used):
mv .vimrc ~/.vim/vimrc 
mv .gvimrc ~/.vim/gvimrc 
Create symbolic links so that ~/.vimrc points to the ~/.vim/vimrc file:
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc 
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc 
Change to the .vim directory, and initialize it as a git repository(used): 
cd ~/.vim 
git init
Create a README file, and paste installation instructions into it 
Add all files, and make an initial commit:
git add .
(i think used git add -a is buch better) 
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master

I suggest publishing your dotvim files to github: it’s really easy to set up an account, and they host open source projects for free. In the video, I demonstrate how to publish a git repository to github.

Keep your plugins in git

The traditional method for installing Vim plugins is to copy each script that is distributed with the plugin into the corresponding .vim subdirectory. 
For example, if you wanted to install Fugitive.vim (a git wrapper for Vim), you would copy the documentation file into .vim/doc, and copy the plugin file into .vim/plugin. You could then check these in to your git repository, and they could be syncronised across machines as easily as the rest of your configuration files. 
But you lose something by doing this. The Fugitive plugin itself is kept under version control with git. It would be much better if you could keep it that way.

Pathogen.vim

The pathogen plugin makes it possible to cleanly install plugins as a bundle. Rather than having to place all of your plugins side by side in the same directory, you can keep all of the files for each individual plugin together in one directory. This makes installation more straightforward, and also simplifies the tasks of upgrading and even removing a plugin if you decide you no longer need it.

To install Pathogen:
download the script and place it in your .vim/autoload directory (if the directory doesn’t exist, you’ll have to create it).

There are a couple of lines that you should add to your .vimrc file to activate pathogen.

call pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles() call pathogen#helptags()

It is essential that these lines are called before enabling filetype detection, so I would recommend putting them at the top of your vimrc file.

Install plugins as submodules

With pathogen installed, it’s now possible to keep the files for each plugin together, which means that every plugin can be kept in its own git repository. 
The best way to do this is to use git submodules, which are designed especially for the purpose of keeping git repositories within a git repository.

To install the fugitive

plugin as a git submodule, take the following steps:

1: cd ~/.vim 
2: mkdir ~/.vim/bundle 
3: git submodule add http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git bundle/fugitive

ps: the better choice path is used bundle/xxx not ~/ or ./

4: git add . 
5: git commit -m "Install Fugitive.vim bundle as a submodule.”
6: git push origin master

delete plugins as submodules

git rm --cached bundle/fugitive      //file

git rm —cached -r xxx             //folder

ignore files

Creat name .gitignore in ~/.vim edit this file,ex: 
bin 
*.db 
*.o
there is enter with every words! 
another option 
1\git rm —cached [pathxxx] 
2\edit .gitmoudles & edit .git/config 
3\delete xxx’s info in these files 
4\delete the file or folder from u disk

Installing your Vim environment on another machine

Once your vim configuration is under version control, it’s quite straightforward to import your settings to any machine that has git installed. If you followed the instructions above to put your vimrc and plugins in a dotvim directory, then you can follow these steps to synchronise them to another machine:

cd ~ git 
clone http://github.com/username/dotvim.git ~/.vim 
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc 
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc 
cd ~/.vim 
git submodule init 
git submodule update

As Marcin Kulik points out in the comments init.

Upgrading a plugin bundle

below, the last two git commands can be rolled in to one: git submodule update&init

At some point in the future, the fugitive plugin might be updated. To fetch the latest changes, go into the fugitive repository, and pull the latest version:

cd ~/.vim/bundle/fugitive git pull origin master

Upgrading all bundled plugins

You can use the foreach command to execute any shell script in from the root of all submodule directories. To update to the latest version of each plugin bundle, run the following:

git submodule foreach git pull origin master
